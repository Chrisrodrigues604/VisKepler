# Population Analysis with Geospatial Data

This Jupyter Notebook provides an analysis of population data using geospatial data visualization techniques. It showcases the usage of various libraries in Python to perform the analysis and create visualizations.

## Libraries Used

- KeplerGl: An interactive geospatial visualization library.
- Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- Geopandas: A library for working with geospatial data in Python.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static visualizations.
- Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

## About

This project is related to the **GETIN** project from Universidade de Aveiro. It explores population data and utilizes geospatial analysis to gain insights into population trends and patterns.

## Dashboard

For a more interactive and visual representation of the data, an interactive dashboard is available at [https://dcstp-drivitup.ua.pt/demodash/](https://dcstp-drivitup.ua.pt/demodash/). The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore the population analysis results.

## Instructions

1. Install the required libraries using the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install keplergl pandas geopandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Aditional Notes

    The notebook uses geospatial data in the form of shapefiles. Make sure you have the necessary shapefiles or update the code accordingly to use your own geospatial data.
